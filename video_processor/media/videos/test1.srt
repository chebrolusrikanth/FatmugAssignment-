00:00:01,144 --> 00:00:03,111
Geez, I can't believe we found
a version of Earth

3
00:00:03,146 --> 00:00:05,313
with a "Ball Fondlers"
movie franchise.

4
00:00:05,348 --> 00:00:08,583
I can't believe the things
this reality considers PG-13.

5
00:00:08,618 --> 00:00:11,319
- Yeah. I-I'm pretty jealous.
- Don't be, Morty.

6
00:00:11,354 --> 00:00:14,222
There's pros and cons to
every alternate timeline

7
00:00:14,257 --> 00:00:15,490
fun facts about this one--

8
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:18,360
It's got giant, telepathic
spiders, 11 9/11s,

9
00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:22,440
and the best ice cream
in the multiverse!

10
00:00:22,475 --> 00:00:25,010
- Shut up!
- We go get some ice cream, mother[bleep]!

11
00:00:27,013 --> 00:00:28,313
Oh, great.

12
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:29,915
Oh, boy.
W-what's wrong, Rick?

13
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:31,750
Is it the quantum carburetor
or something?

14
00:00:31,784 --> 00:00:33,885
"Quantum carburetor"?
Jesus, Morty.

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,554
You can't just add
a--

16
00:00:35,588 --> 00:00:37,856
Sci-Fi word to a car word
and hope it means something.

17
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,330
Huh, looks like something's wrong
with the microverse battery.

18
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:43,595
- We're gonna have to go inside.
- Um, go inside what?

19
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:45,463
The battery, Morty.
Be right back, Summer.

20
00:00:45,531 --> 00:00:46,898
Stay put,
don't touch any buttons,

21
00:00:46,966 --> 00:00:50,335
and ignore all random thoughts
that feel... spidery.

22
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:51,770
Wait!
You can't leave me here!

23
00:00:51,804 --> 00:00:54,506
You'll be fine.
Ship, keep Summer safe.

Ugh.
Wonderful.

27
00:01:05,484 --> 00:01:07,519
Hey, excuse me.
Hello.

28
00:01:07,587 --> 00:01:09,588
Um...

29
00:01:09,622 --> 00:01:11,590
What, you think
you're better than me?!

30
00:01:11,624 --> 00:01:13,658
Nobody's better than me!

31
00:01:13,693 --> 00:01:14,893
Hey!
Hey!

32
00:01:19,131 --> 00:01:20,932
Aah!
Aaaaah!

00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:23,735
Hey, man, what the hell?!

35
00:01:23,803 --> 00:01:25,837
That was my daughter's
pediatrician! Aah!

36
00:01:25,872 --> 00:01:27,639
No, stop!
Don't kill him!

Oh, God.
I can't feel my legs.

40
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:34,613
Help!
Help!!

41
00:01:34,647 --> 00:01:37,349
<i>- Summer is safe.</i>
- I don't feel safe.

42
00:01:37,383 --> 00:01:39,050
<i>Confirmed.</i>

43
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:41,419
No.

Oh, God, help me.
Help me!

Oh, man.
Where are we, Rick?

49
00:02:20,426 --> 00:02:21,826
Morty, remember
eight seconds ago

50
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:23,461
when when you said,
"Go inside what?"

51
00:02:23,496 --> 00:02:24,930
And I said, "The battery"?

52
00:02:24,964 --> 00:02:26,631
And then we showed up here,
and I wasn't like,

53
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:27,899
"Whoa, this is unexpected.

54
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:29,901
This is not what I was
expecting, Morty.

55
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:31,536
- What a perplexing mystery this is."
- All right, all right.

56
00:02:31,604 --> 00:02:33,471
We're inside the battery.
I get it.

57
00:02:33,506 --> 00:02:35,507
- You don't have to bust my balls.
- Huh, this isn't right.

58
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:36,875
This pipe's supposed
to be sending

59
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:39,678
20 terawatts of juice
up to the engine, Morty.

60
00:02:39,712 --> 00:02:41,513
Instead we've got... zero?

61
00:02:41,547 --> 00:02:42,814
Now what
are these people doing?

62
00:02:42,848 --> 00:02:45,150
W-w-w-whoa, people?

63
00:02:45,184 --> 00:02:46,851
It's time for some
hands-on engine repair.

64
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:49,654
- All right, Morty, hold on to something.
- Whoa!

65
00:02:52,024 --> 00:02:53,525
Holy crap!

66
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:54,826
I thought we were inside
your car battery, Rick.

67
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,096
T-t-this is like a whole
p-planet or something.

68
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,031
Thanks, Morty. I'm pretty proud
of this bad boy.

69
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:01,433
Check it out.

70
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,437
I put a spatially tessellated void
inside a modified temporal field

71
00:03:05,504 --> 00:03:07,872
until a planet developed
intelligent life.

72
00:03:07,907 --> 00:03:10,909
I then introduced that life
to the wonders of electricity,

73
00:03:10,977 --> 00:03:12,844
which they now generate
on a global scale.

74
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:14,713
And, you know, some of it goes
to power my engine

75
00:03:14,747 --> 00:03:15,981
and charge my phone and stuff.

76
00:03:16,016 --> 00:03:18,516
You have a whole planet sitting
around making your power for you?

77
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:19,818
That's slavery.

78
00:03:19,852 --> 00:03:21,987
It's society.
They work for each other, Morty.

79
00:03:22,021 --> 00:03:23,922
They pay each other.
They buy houses.

80
00:03:23,956 --> 00:03:25,657
They get married
and make children

81
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:27,092
that replace them when they get
too old to make power.

82
00:03:27,126 --> 00:03:29,194
That just sounds like slavery
with extra steps.

83
00:03:29,228 --> 00:03:32,163
Ooh-la-la, someone's
gonna get laid in college.

84
00:03:32,198 --> 00:03:34,566
It appears we are
being revisited

85
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,502
by the alien known as Rick,
who once gave our world

86
00:03:37,536 --> 00:03:39,604
the gift of gooble box
technology,

87
00:03:39,638 --> 00:03:42,140
which, when stomped on,
generates electricity,

88
00:03:42,174 --> 00:03:43,808
powering our homes
and businesses,

89
00:03:43,843 --> 00:03:45,510
improving our daily lives,
while safely removing

90
00:03:45,544 --> 00:03:50,115
the dangerous waste power
to a special disposal volcano.

91
00:03:50,182 --> 00:03:51,816
But why has Rick returned?

92
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:54,452
And what will he say
when he hears the big news?

93
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:56,087
Let's find out.

94
00:03:56,122 --> 00:03:58,490
You need to tell these people
they're in a battery, Rick.

95
00:03:58,557 --> 00:04:00,992
It's messed up.
There's caterers down there.

96
00:04:01,027 --> 00:04:03,194
Th-th-they're setting up
chafing dishes.

97
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:04,286
Would you relax, Morty?

98
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,631
There's nothing dishonest
about what we're doing.

99
00:04:06,665 --> 00:04:08,199
Now slap on these antennae.

100
00:04:08,234 --> 00:04:10,101
- These people need to think we're aliens.
- What? Why?

101
00:04:10,136 --> 00:04:14,039
Obviously you really
know nothing about car repair.

102
00:04:18,144 --> 00:04:20,145
Wait for the ramp, Morty.

103
00:04:20,179 --> 00:04:21,813
They love the slow ramp.

104
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:24,716
Really gets their dicks hard
when they see this ramp

105
00:04:24,784 --> 00:04:27,018
just slowly extending down.

106
00:04:28,854 --> 00:04:31,289
Greetings!

107
00:04:32,758 --> 00:04:34,225
Morty, you got
to flip them off.

108
00:04:34,293 --> 00:04:36,227
I told them it means
"Peace among worlds."

109
00:04:36,295 --> 00:04:37,595
How hilarious is that?

110
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:45,236
Coming through.

111
00:04:45,271 --> 00:04:47,505
Two real aliens walking
through here.

112
00:04:47,573 --> 00:04:49,507
Rick, our alien friend.

113
00:04:49,575 --> 00:04:51,676
Uh, Mr. President,
um, couldn't help but notice

114
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,845
that you were having problems
generating power.

115
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:56,214
That's correct.
We've evolved.

116
00:04:56,248 --> 00:04:59,684
Our most brilliant scientist,
Zeep Xanflorp,

117
00:04:59,718 --> 00:05:01,519
has developed
a source of energy

118
00:05:01,554 --> 00:05:03,288
that makes gooble boxes
obsolete.

119
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,024
I would love to see it.

120
00:05:06,058 --> 00:05:08,793
[Bleep] you.
What did you say to me?!

121
00:05:08,828 --> 00:05:09,928
"[Bleep] you."

122
00:05:09,995 --> 00:05:12,797
Y-you told me
it means "much obliged".

123
00:05:12,832 --> 00:05:15,867
Oh. Right.
Uh, b-blow me.

124
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:17,602
No, no, no.
Blow <i>me</i>.

125
00:05:21,841 --> 00:05:25,910
Zeep, you have an honored guest
from beyond the stars.

126
00:05:25,945 --> 00:05:28,865
I said 12 quantum stabilizers,
not 11.

127
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:30,589
Fix it or it's your ass.

128
00:05:30,635 --> 00:05:32,168
Chris, I'm in the middle
of something.

129
00:05:32,203 --> 00:05:35,538
Zeep, is Rick--
The alien.

130
00:05:35,573 --> 00:05:37,040
Rick the alien.

131
00:05:37,074 --> 00:05:39,442
Rick the alien...

132
00:05:39,477 --> 00:05:41,044
Really?
You're gonna pull that move?

133
00:05:41,078 --> 00:05:42,746
I guided
your entire civilization.

134
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,848
Your people have
a holiday named Ricksgiving.

135
00:05:44,882 --> 00:05:46,483
They teach kids
about me in school.

136
00:05:46,517 --> 00:05:47,684
I dropped out of school.

137
00:05:47,718 --> 00:05:49,052
It's not a place
for smart people.

138
00:05:49,086 --> 00:05:50,954
Ohhhh, snap!

139
00:05:50,988 --> 00:05:52,889
Listen to me,
you arrogant little--

140
00:05:52,923 --> 00:05:56,059
R-Rick was hoping
to see your new energy source.

141
00:05:56,093 --> 00:05:59,095
I think he could learn
a lot from you, Zeep.

142
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,597
Fine.

143
00:06:00,631 --> 00:06:02,699
It's hard for people to grasp,

144
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:05,702
but inside that container is
an infinite universe

145
00:06:05,736 --> 00:06:09,139
with a planet capable of generating
massive amounts of power.

146
00:06:09,173 --> 00:06:11,508
I call it a miniverse.

147
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:13,576
Dumb name.

148
00:06:13,644 --> 00:06:14,978
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

149
00:06:15,012 --> 00:06:17,147
I mean, it's hard
for us to comprehend all this.

150
00:06:17,181 --> 00:06:19,883
Would it be possible
for us to get some kind of tour

151
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:21,751
of your miniverse
from the inside?

152
00:06:21,786 --> 00:06:23,708
This isn't a [bleep]
chocolate factory.

153
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:24,621
I don't have time.

154
00:06:24,655 --> 00:06:27,157
Didn't you say time goes
more slowly in the miniverse

155
00:06:27,191 --> 00:06:28,658
relative to the real world?

156
00:06:28,693 --> 00:06:31,027
Yes, Chris.
Thanks for reminding me of that.

157
00:06:31,062 --> 00:06:33,563
Great president.
All right, let's go.

158
00:06:33,597 --> 00:06:35,098
Whoa-oh!

159
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,266
Hold on to something.

160
00:06:37,818 --> 00:06:40,019
I put an unbounded vacuum
inside a temporal field

161
00:06:40,054 --> 00:06:41,621
until a world developed.

162
00:06:41,655 --> 00:06:43,590
I then introduced
the people of this world

163
00:06:43,624 --> 00:06:46,860
to the wonders of electricity
in the form of a device

164
00:06:46,894 --> 00:06:48,595
I call a flooble crank.

165
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:50,029
What they don't know is

166
00:06:50,064 --> 00:06:53,199
that 80% of every crank's
energy output gets channeled

167
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:55,735
out of the miniverse
to be used by us.

168
00:06:55,803 --> 00:06:57,303
No more gooble boxes.

169
00:06:57,338 --> 00:06:59,272
I got to tell you, Zeep,
with no disrespect,

170
00:06:59,306 --> 00:07:01,674
I really think what
you're doing here is unethical.

171
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:03,143
- It's not cool.
- What?!

172
00:07:03,177 --> 00:07:06,112
Y-y-you got the people
on this world slaving away

173
00:07:06,147 --> 00:07:07,847
making your power.

174
00:07:07,882 --> 00:07:09,349
I mean,
that's what I call slavery.

175
00:07:09,383 --> 00:07:11,284
No, no, no,
they work for each other

176
00:07:11,318 --> 00:07:13,553
in exchange for money,
which they then--

177
00:07:13,587 --> 00:07:16,756
Well, that just sounds like
slavery with extra steps.

178
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:20,593
Eek barba dirkle, somebody's
gonna get laid in college.

179
00:07:20,628 --> 00:07:21,895
Rick, a word?

180
00:07:21,929 --> 00:07:23,029
What the hell was that?

181
00:07:23,063 --> 00:07:24,831
I know.
"Eek barba dirkle"?

182
00:07:24,865 --> 00:07:26,633
That's a pretty
[bleep] up "ooh-la-la".

183
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:28,301
No, what are you doing
telling this guy

184
00:07:28,335 --> 00:07:29,969
that his miniverse is
unethical?

185
00:07:30,004 --> 00:07:32,105
Do you not see
the hypocrisy here?

186
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:34,007
Holy crap.
You're right, Morty.

187
00:07:34,074 --> 00:07:35,608
Hypocrisy.

188
00:07:35,643 --> 00:07:37,744
Somewhere on this planet,
there's got to be

189
00:07:37,778 --> 00:07:40,046
an arrogant scientist prick on the
verge of microverse technology,

190
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:42,348
which would threaten to make
Zeep's flooble cranks obsolete,

191
00:07:42,383 --> 00:07:44,150
forcing Zeep to say
microverses are bad,

192
00:07:44,185 --> 00:07:47,053
at which point he'll realize
what a hypocrite he's being,

193
00:07:47,087 --> 00:07:49,989
his people will go back to
stomping on their gooble boxes,

194
00:07:50,024 --> 00:07:52,358
and you and I will be
on ice cream street, baby!

195
00:07:52,393 --> 00:07:54,194
Eating that mother[bleep]
ice cream!

196
00:07:54,228 --> 00:07:56,195
Slurping, slurping,
slurping it up.

197
00:07:56,997 --> 00:07:58,398
Wh-wh-why are you making
that face?

198
00:07:58,432 --> 00:07:59,866
Holy [bleep]!

199
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,956
It's me.

200
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,002
I've convinced the people of
this planet that I'm a traveler

201
00:08:03,036 --> 00:08:04,003
from another world.

202
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:06,005
You don't think that's
overdoing it a little?

203
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,674
I mean, you could achieve
the same effect

204
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:08,975
with a pair of--
Never mind.

205
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:10,410
You know what?
I shouldn't be so critical.

206
00:08:10,444 --> 00:08:11,811
I'm an alien.

207
00:08:11,846 --> 00:08:13,847
Places, please.
We're about to land.

208
00:08:17,184 --> 00:08:19,752
Too fast.

209
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:25,725
<i>Law enforcement
converging on location.</i>

210
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,993
<i>Keep Summer safe.</i>

211
00:08:27,027 --> 00:08:29,395
No! No, no!
Don't hurt anybody!

212
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,398
<i>Confirm custom defense protocol--</i>

213
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:35,201
<i>Keep Summer safe--
No physical force.</i>

214
00:08:35,236 --> 00:08:37,519
- Yes.
- <i>Processing.</i>

215
00:08:37,554 --> 00:08:40,289
Come out of the vehicle
with your hands in the air!

216
00:08:40,323 --> 00:08:42,057
<i>Scanning assailants.</i>

217
00:08:44,994 --> 00:08:47,396
<i>Psychological option detected.</i>

218
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,498
<i>Gestating.</i>

219
00:08:49,532 --> 00:08:50,866
"Gestating"?

220
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,469
Come out with your hands up,
or we will be forced to open fire!

221
00:08:55,638 --> 00:08:57,267
- Incoming!
- We got a device!

222
00:08:57,292 --> 00:08:58,421
Bomb! Bomb!

223
00:09:01,311 --> 00:09:02,511
Daddy?

224
00:09:02,545 --> 00:09:04,513
Oh, my God.

225
00:09:04,547 --> 00:09:06,181
- Hunter?
- Daddy?

226
00:09:06,215 --> 00:09:07,950
What the hell?

227
00:09:07,984 --> 00:09:10,285
Jesus Christ,
cease fire! Stay back!

228
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,453
H-h-hunter?

229
00:09:11,487 --> 00:09:13,255
- Daddy.
- Hunter!

230
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:15,257
Oh, my dear, sweet God, Hunter.

231
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,592
Oh, my boy.
My boy.

232
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:19,061
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It was all my fault.

233
00:09:19,095 --> 00:09:21,263
- I'm sorry.
- Daddy, leave the car alone.

234
00:09:21,297 --> 00:09:22,431
W-w-w-what?

235
00:09:22,498 --> 00:09:24,533
Leave the car alone.

236
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:26,201
Hunter?
Don't--

237
00:09:26,235 --> 00:09:27,336
Oh, my God.

238
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,638
Stay here, Hunter!
No!

239
00:09:29,672 --> 00:09:32,574
God, no!
Hunter!

240
00:09:34,077 --> 00:09:36,378
<i>All of you have loved ones.</i>

241
00:09:36,412 --> 00:09:39,014
<i>All can be returned.
All can be taken away.</i>

242
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:41,316
<i>Please step away
from the vehicle.</i>

243
00:09:42,285 --> 00:09:44,620
<i>Keep Summer safe.</i>

244
00:09:44,654 --> 00:09:47,422
And if you continue
to turn your flooble cranks,

245
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,125
I will bring you
other great alien advancements.

246
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,461
- Hey, uh, let me ask you something.
- Yes?

247
00:09:52,495 --> 00:09:55,063
Any of your, uh, scientists
working on anything new?

248
00:09:55,131 --> 00:09:56,598
All of them.
That's their job.

249
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:59,067
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But I mean, like, energy-wise.

250
00:09:59,135 --> 00:10:01,503
Anyone working on, say,
a little universe in a box?

251
00:10:01,537 --> 00:10:03,639
How do you know about that?
It's top secret.

252
00:10:03,706 --> 00:10:07,576
So remember-- a crank
a day is not nearly enough.

253
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,277
Crank it.

254
00:10:09,345 --> 00:10:12,114
I told them this means
"Peace among worlds".

255
00:10:12,148 --> 00:10:15,217
- How hilarious is that?
- Re-really funny, Zeep.

256
00:10:15,251 --> 00:10:17,586
Hey, Zeep, the fake president
of your fake world

257
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,688
has something fake important
to show you.

258
00:10:22,158 --> 00:10:23,059
It's not much now,

259
00:10:23,084 --> 00:10:25,461
but once I learn to accelerate
the temporal field,

260
00:10:25,495 --> 00:10:27,629
I'll be able to interact
with any sentient life

261
00:10:27,664 --> 00:10:29,464
that evolves and introduce them

262
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:32,234
to the wonders of electricity
via a pulley-based device

263
00:10:32,301 --> 00:10:33,502
I call a blooble yank.

264
00:10:33,536 --> 00:10:35,904
But what
they won't know is--

265
00:10:35,972 --> 00:10:37,673
You'll be taking
most of their energy.

266
00:10:37,707 --> 00:10:39,241
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I get it.

267
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:41,610
It's showtime.

268
00:10:45,381 --> 00:10:48,950
You do realize this will make
the flooble crank obsolete?

269
00:10:48,985 --> 00:10:52,287
This is wrong, Kyle.
What you're doing is wrong.

270
00:10:52,355 --> 00:10:54,589
You're basically--
This is slavery.

271
00:10:54,624 --> 00:10:57,125
You're talking about creating
a planet of slaves.

272
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,462
- Told you, Zeep.
- Oh, they won't be slaves.

273
00:11:00,496 --> 00:11:02,631
They'll work for each other
and pay each other money.

274
00:11:02,665 --> 00:11:07,703
That just sounds like slavery
with ex... tra... steps.

275
00:11:07,737 --> 00:11:09,504
- What?
- Wait a minute.

276
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:12,174
Did you create my universe?
Is my universe a miniverse?

277
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:14,509
- Microverse!
- Uh, teenyverse.

278
00:11:14,544 --> 00:11:16,344
Ugh!
You bastard!

279
00:11:16,412 --> 00:11:18,480
Much obliged.

280
00:11:18,504 --> 00:11:21,004
- What the hell is happening?
- This is healthy, trust me.

281
00:11:21,184 --> 00:11:23,018
You're my battery, mother[bleep].

282
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:24,319
That's all you are.

283
00:11:24,353 --> 00:11:26,321
I made you.
Your microverse sucks!

284
00:11:26,345 --> 00:11:28,945
And your miniverse is the size
of a [bleep] lobster tank!

285
00:11:28,969 --> 00:11:29,725
It's whack!

286
00:11:29,726 --> 00:11:32,027
Are they not really aliens?

287
00:11:32,095 --> 00:11:36,198
Nah, they're just a couple of crazy,
wacky scientists, you know?

288
00:11:36,232 --> 00:11:37,599
So he made a universe,

289
00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:39,301
and that guy is
from <i>that</i> universe.

290
00:11:39,335 --> 00:11:41,636
And that guy made a universe.

291
00:11:41,671 --> 00:11:45,240
And that's the universe
where I was born.

292
00:11:45,274 --> 00:11:47,476
Where my father died.

293
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,711
Where I couldn't make time
for his funeral

294
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:54,216
because I was working
on my universe.

295
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,017
- I made you!
- Yeah.

296
00:11:56,052 --> 00:11:57,719
Science, huh?
Ain't it a thing.

297
00:11:57,754 --> 00:12:00,055
You know, one time,
Rick sh-- accidentally shot

298
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:01,690
his laser pistol
right through my hand.

299
00:12:01,724 --> 00:12:05,293
You know, I mean, like,
old-lady science, you know?

300
00:12:05,328 --> 00:12:07,129
She's a real--

301
00:12:07,163 --> 00:12:08,463
You got to hang on tight,
you know?

302
00:12:08,498 --> 00:12:11,299
Because she-- she'll--
She bucks pretty hard.

303
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:14,336
Ooh, boy, what--
Oh, my God, no!

304
00:12:19,308 --> 00:12:20,442
- Teenyverse.
- Teenyverse.

305
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:24,126
Come on, come on, come on.

306
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:25,261
Pterodactyl!

307
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,297
Asshole!

308
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:28,932
When I get
out of this teenyverse,

309
00:12:28,966 --> 00:12:30,834
I'm gonna smash it to pieces
with you in it.

310
00:12:30,868 --> 00:12:32,569
Yeah, well, when I get
out of this teenyverse,

311
00:12:32,603 --> 00:12:34,437
I'm gonna get out of
the surrounding miniverse

312
00:12:34,472 --> 00:12:36,406
and then the microverse
around that, and guess what?

313
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,907
Don't make things worse, Rick!

314
00:12:37,942 --> 00:12:39,909
Uh, he's not gonna destroy
your universe.

315
00:12:39,944 --> 00:12:41,911
You know, we--
We need it to start our car.

316
00:12:41,946 --> 00:12:44,280
That's what you used
my universe for?

317
00:12:44,315 --> 00:12:45,949
To run your car?

318
00:12:45,983 --> 00:12:47,350
Yeah, but don't
flatter yourself.

319
00:12:47,385 --> 00:12:50,086
There's always AAA,
you [bleep] [bleep]sucker!

320
00:12:51,155 --> 00:12:53,022
What's he doing?
What's he crafting?

321
00:12:53,057 --> 00:12:54,524
I can craft stuff, too, pal!

322
00:12:54,558 --> 00:12:56,393
Just like I crafted
your reality!

323
00:12:57,661 --> 00:12:59,062
You crafty son of a--

324
00:12:59,096 --> 00:13:00,296
Ow!

325
00:13:00,331 --> 00:13:03,933
I crafted the guy that created
the planet you're standing on!

326
00:13:03,968 --> 00:13:06,369
Yeah, and I made the stars that became
the carbon in your mother's ovaries!

327
00:13:06,404 --> 00:13:08,171
I didn't ask to be born!

328
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:09,606
All right, that's it!
I'm out.

329
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,474
I-I'm gonna go
into the wilderness,

330
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:14,477
and I'm gonna make a new life for
myself among the tree people.

331
00:13:14,512 --> 00:13:16,913
- It can't be worse than this.
- Sure. Okay, Morty.

332
00:13:16,947 --> 00:13:19,349
Just be back before sundown
or the tree people will eat you.

333
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,383
That's a myth!

334
00:13:20,418 --> 00:13:22,318
W-w-why are you trying
to start a myth?

335
00:13:22,353 --> 00:13:23,887
It's a prehistoric planet, Morty.

336
00:13:23,954 --> 00:13:25,455
Someone has to bring
a little culture.

337
00:13:25,489 --> 00:13:27,123
And it certainly can't be someone

338
00:13:27,158 --> 00:13:30,293
whose entire culture powers
my brake lights!

339
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,863
Go, go, go!

340
00:13:35,863 --> 00:13:37,864
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.

341
00:13:37,888 --> 00:13:39,588
What are we going to do now?

342
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:42,434
<i>I am unable
to destroy this army.</i>

343
00:13:42,468 --> 00:13:45,871
<i>To clarify, I am quite able
to destroy this army,</i>

344
00:13:45,905 --> 00:13:48,139
- <i>but you will not permit it.</i>
- Correct.

345
00:13:48,207 --> 00:13:51,509
<i>You also refuse to authorize
emotional countermeasures.</i>

346
00:13:51,544 --> 00:13:54,512
If you're talking
about the melting ghost babies,

347
00:13:54,547 --> 00:13:56,481
yes, please, no more of that.

348
00:13:56,515 --> 00:13:58,483
<i>Confirmed.</i>

349
00:13:58,543 --> 00:14:01,543
<i>I am currently constructing
a security measure</i>

350
00:14:01,554 --> 00:14:03,421
<i>in compliance
with your parameters.</i>

351
00:14:03,456 --> 00:14:06,758
<i>But I do want to say
you are not making this easy.</i>

352
00:14:06,826 --> 00:14:08,360
You know you're
kind of a dick, right?

353
00:14:08,394 --> 00:14:11,396
<i>My function is
to keep Summer safe,</i>

354
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,532
<i>not keep Summer being,
like, totally stoked</i>

355
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:17,469
<i>about, like,
the general vibe and stuff.</i>

356
00:14:17,503 --> 00:14:20,171
<i>That's you.
That's how you talk.</i>

357
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:26,178
Hey, that's my deer!

358
00:14:27,713 --> 00:14:29,181
Aaaaaaah!

359
00:14:29,215 --> 00:14:30,515
Raah!

360
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,618
I hope your God is
as big a dick as you.

361
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:39,257
My God's the biggest dick
that's never existed.

362
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:41,159
Why do you think I'm even here?

363
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:45,205
You're here

364
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,408
because you created
someone smarter than you.

365
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:53,380
Oh, I thought we were both here because
I created a universe of idiots.

366
00:14:59,854 --> 00:15:02,456
Kalo kada sha la.

367
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:03,590
Holy shit.
Morty?

368
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,259
I haven't seen you in months.

369
00:15:05,293 --> 00:15:06,827
You're leading the tree people?

370
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:08,295
Huh.
That's a step up.

371
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:09,496
We have no leaders.

372
00:15:09,564 --> 00:15:12,132
We follow
only the will of the forest.

373
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:13,300
Ooh. Wow.

374
00:15:13,334 --> 00:15:16,370
- Gaaaaay.
- That is pretty gay.

375
00:15:16,404 --> 00:15:18,238
You two call yourselves
geniuses,

376
00:15:18,273 --> 00:15:20,874
but you have spent
this time learning nothing.

377
00:15:20,909 --> 00:15:22,776
Come with me into the forest.

378
00:15:22,811 --> 00:15:25,345
There is something
I wish to teach you.

379
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:32,386
This is ku'ala,
the spirit tree.

380
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,354
For generations,
it has guided the--

381
00:15:35,557 --> 00:15:37,691
You have to get us
the [bleep] out of here.

382
00:15:37,725 --> 00:15:39,560
These people are
backwards savages.

383
00:15:39,594 --> 00:15:41,195
They eat every third baby

384
00:15:41,229 --> 00:15:43,363
because they think
it makes fruit grow bigger.

385
00:15:43,398 --> 00:15:45,899
Everyone's gross, and they all
smell like piss all the time.

386
00:15:45,934 --> 00:15:48,502
I m-- I miss my family.
I miss my laptop.

387
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,772
I masturbated to an extra-curvy
piece of driftwood the other day!

388
00:15:51,806 --> 00:15:53,507
Look, I don't care
what it takes.

389
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,209
You two are putting aside
your bull[bleep],

390
00:15:55,243 --> 00:15:57,578
and you're working together
to get us back home.

391
00:15:57,612 --> 00:15:59,513
No can do, Morty.
I just can't.

392
00:15:59,547 --> 00:16:01,348
I just don't see how I can--

393
00:16:01,382 --> 00:16:02,649
Ro ro dah no gah!

394
00:16:02,684 --> 00:16:05,419
You're smart.
You'll figure it out.

395
00:16:05,453 --> 00:16:09,556
You have 10
seconds to get out of the ship!

396
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:11,492
10, 9...

397
00:16:12,494 --> 00:16:13,760
All right, not bad.

398
00:16:13,795 --> 00:16:15,863
I guess you're
an okay proto recombinator.

399
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,465
I've certainly seen
worse ionic cell dioxination.

400
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,167
If this works,
drinks are on me.

401
00:16:20,201 --> 00:16:21,869
If drinks are on you,
you're gonna need

402
00:16:21,936 --> 00:16:23,604
a second mortgage
on that tower.

403
00:16:23,638 --> 00:16:25,139
I'm an alcoholic.

404
00:16:25,206 --> 00:16:26,707
Opium addict.

405
00:16:28,943 --> 00:16:31,545
All right, okay, okay,
okay, wrap it up.

406
00:16:31,613 --> 00:16:34,448
You guys are the [bleep] worst!
Your gods are a lie!

407
00:16:34,516 --> 00:16:36,950
[Bleep] you, [bleep] nature,
and [bleep] trees!

408
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:40,754
Yes! You did it!
Yes!

409
00:16:40,788 --> 00:16:42,523
Hey, uh, how about that drink?

410
00:16:42,557 --> 00:16:45,626
Sure, I just need to go grab
my wallet from inside my ship.

411
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,194
Isour wallet in your ship?

412
00:16:47,262 --> 00:16:50,230
That's where the transporter is,
too, so why don't we come with?

413
00:16:50,265 --> 00:16:53,444
It's cool.
I'll be back in a sec.

414
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:56,948
You know how long a second can
take in a microverse?

415
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:58,983
Oh!
Run, Morty!

416
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,319
That asshole's willing to risk everything
he cares about just to defeat me!

417
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,487
He's psychotic!

418
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,692
- Morty, hop on my back.
- Why?

419
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,061
Go, go Sanchez ski shoes.

420
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,898
Aaaaaah!
...Eight...

421
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,334
Aaaah!
Oof!

422
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,704
Hold still.

423
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:24,676
Oh, hey, guys. I just
finished cooking us a feast.

424
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,477
Aaaah!
Holy--

425
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,680
- You monster!
- Whoa. Bad tour.

426
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,381
...seven...

427
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,016
Hey, you got to sign out.

428
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,552
Nothing you do matters!
Your existence is a lie!

429
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,389
If that were
really true, then...

430
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,458
- I'm here to see Ron Mendleson.
- Third floor.

431
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:41,993
Would you like
to go to dinner with--

432
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,795
Uh, no.

433
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,934
You may have created this
universe, Rick, but I live in it.

434
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:51,469
[Bleep]

435
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,638
What are we gonna do, Rick?
We're so screwed.

436
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,073
He's gonna get to the
ship and smash the microverse,

437
00:17:55,098 --> 00:17:56,098
and then he's gonna kill us!

438
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,667
Quick, Morty, you've
got to turn into a car.

439
00:17:57,692 --> 00:17:58,176
What?!

440
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,611
A long time ago, I implanted you
with a subdermal chip

441
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,114
that could call upon dormant
nanobots in your bloodstream

442
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,516
to restructure your anatomy
and turn you into a car.

443
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:06,784
- Oh, my God!
- Concentrate, Morty.

444
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,339
Concentrate and turn
into a car, Morty.

445
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,622
Never mind. Here's a taxi.
Get in. It's fine.

446
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,124
...six...

447
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:16,961
- Hey, Zeep.
- Huh?

448
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:19,697
Happy Ricksgiving, biiiiiitch.

449
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,833
Aaah!

450
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,534
We did it, Morty.

451
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,103
Now let's get out of here
and destroy this whole universe.

452
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,471
Excuse me?

453
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:27,905
...five--

454
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,607
Sir?

455
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,944
- Holy hell.
- Sir!

456
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,213
Hold you fire!

457
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,751
What's going on?

458
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,519
<i>I have brokered
a peace agreement</i>

459
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,621
<i>between the giant spiders
and the government.</i>

460
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:47,058
Thanks to the skilled diplomacy
of this mysterious space car,

461
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,994
from this day forward,
human- and spiderkind will live

462
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,863
side by side in peace.

463
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,699
We will stop bombing them,
and they will no longer use

464
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,768
their telepathic abilities
to make us wander into webs

465
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,469
for later consumption.

466
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,571
Instead, we will work together
to make this world

467
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:04,609
a better place for all,
no matter how many legs.

468
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:06,778
What do we do
about the space car?

469
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,146
Leave it alone.

470
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,814
I mean, what did it
really do, anyways?

471
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,115
Kill a guy
and paralyze his buddy?

472
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,018
Not a bad trade
for spider peace.

473
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:15,987
All right, that's it.
Move out!

474
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,728
I love this spider!

475
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:25,496
<i>Summer is safe.</i>

476
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:26,998
All right, I get it.

477
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,236
Rick!

478
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,573
Don't do it.

479
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:38,876
You quit school, but you
still got some learning to do.

480
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,690
Aah!

481
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,125
Unh!

482
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,002
Class dismissed.

483
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,271
Geez.

484
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,515
- You all right?
- Uh-huh!

485
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,783
What are you doing, Rick?

486
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,551
I'm pretty sure
the battery's dead.

487
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:21,886
Oh, you think so, huh, Morty?

488
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,087
Well, let's see.

489
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:25,990
Hey, wait-- huh?
I don't get it.

490
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,259
Of course you don't.
But Zeep did.

491
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:29,861
He knew that once I got
back to my car,

492
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,796
one of two things
was gonna happen--

493
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,865
I was gonna have to toss
a broken battery,

494
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,734
or the battery wouldn't
be broken.

495
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:45,042
Peace among worlds, Rick.

496
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,244
Jesus.

497
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,579
Yeah.
Listen to that baby purr.

498
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:49,381
You were right, Morty--

499
00:20:49,406 --> 00:20:51,149
We really just needed to
be honest with those guys.

500
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,383
All right, here we go.

501
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,821
Thank y-o-o-ou.

502
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,823
See, Morty?
This is what it's all about.

503
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:00,291
This is why we do what we do.

504
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:01,792
- Uh-huh.
- Ew! What the hell?

505
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,961
Jesus!
There's flies in my ice cream.

506
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,229
Presidential decree--

507
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:09,333
All ice cream is now for all beings,
no matter how many legs.

508
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:11,435
- What the [bleep] did you do, Summer?!
- It was your ship!

509
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,070
- Your stupid ship did it!
- Don't blame my ship!

510
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,939
- It melted a child!
- My ship doesn't do anything...

511
00:21:15,006 --> 00:21:16,474
- It killed it itself!
- ...unless it's told to do something!

512
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,348
- We almost died!
- I don't want to hear it, Summer!

513
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,411
Your boobs are all hanging about,

514
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,380
and you ruined ice cream
with your boobs out.

515
